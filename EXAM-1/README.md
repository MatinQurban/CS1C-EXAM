# Exam 1 - Matin Qurbanzadeh

## Write a C++ program to model an Address Book. 


### Requirements:
***
1. The address book can hold up to 10 entries (use an array, it does not have to be a dynamic array; do not use vectors).

2. Each entry stores the first name, last name, telephone, and email of a person.

3. The operations that are supported on the Address Book include:

   a) Printing the address book - you can output in any format you want, just make it look readable.

   b) Add entry - if the address book is full, let the user know. If not, add it to the address book.

   c) Find an entry in the address book - given the first name and last name of the person, find the entry. The program should notify the user if an entry does not exist in the address book that matches.

 

### Submission:
***

Using the information provided above, create your program. Use whatever classes and functions you deem necessary. Please spend time thinking about your design. It is an important part of your grade. A working program by itself is good for approximately 60% of your grade. The rest is dependent on your design and code structure.

Test your program by writing a main() that demonstrates the following:

1. Adding 10 entries into the address book (use a loop and hard code your data)

2. Try adding the 11th entry, and show that an error is displayed

3. Print the address book

4. Search for a person in the address book. Once found, print the entry.

5. Search for a person not in the address book. Show how you report the fact that the person is missing from the address book.

 

You must only submit a single file. You can copy and paste each of your code files into a single file and save it as a PDF. Please use page breaks and make sure each of your files starts on a new page of the PDF.

Make sure to include your OUTPUT at the end of your PDF.

 

## Grading Criteria:

This is a relatively simple program. The program must work correctly. A good portion of your grade will be on how you design it. 

Did you use classes effectively?

Are you using pointers/references appropriately?

etc.
